> Reddit bot that givin' M. Kemal Ataturk quotes when Ataturk mentioned on comments coded with Python and JavaScript

# Python (main.py)

Make sure to replace the placeholder values with your actual Reddit bot credentials, such as the ```YOUR_CLIENT_ID```, ```YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET```, ```YOUR_USER_AGENT```, ```YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME``` and ```YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD```. 

Also, update the photo_url variable with the actual URL of the Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk photo you want to share. This code uses the ```praw library``` to interact with the **Reddit API** and the time module to implement the cooldown period. Before running the script, make sure you have praw installed (```pip install praw```).

> **Warning** Remember to use the bot responsibly and respect the Reddit API usage guidelines and the rules of the subreddit you're targeting.

# JavaScript (main.js)

Please note that you need to replace the placeholders (```YOUR_CLIENT_ID```, ```YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET```, ```YOUR_REDDIT_USERNAME```, ```YOUR_REDDIT_PASSWORD```, ```YOUR_SUBREDDIT```) with your actual **Reddit API** credentials and desired subreddit information. Additionally, make sure to install the necessary dependencies (```snoowrap and snoostorm```) using **npm** before running the code.
